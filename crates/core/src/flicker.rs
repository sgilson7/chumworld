//! Flicker (T3, CW-18): two surfaces drawn in one plane, facing one way,
//! fight for the depth buffer, and which of them shows changes from frame to
//! frame as the camera moves (z-fighting). This finds them in the static
//! array the page receives. Ported from Long Time Comin's `flicker.rs`,
//! with three changes: it reads `render::Scene` (both depth layers),
//! `Seen::apart` uses the depth step of the layer that draws a distance, and
//! faces in one plane are swept in order along one axis, so ground made of
//! tens of thousands of coplanar triangles scans in a moment.
//!
//! A face is one triangle of a flat-sided mesh (`prim::MeshTable::flat_faced`)
//! drawn as an opaque solid, placed. Two faces fight when they face the same
//! way, overlap by more than `MIN_AREA`, differ in colour, value or pass
//! (same-coloured faces in one plane fight invisibly), and their planes are
//! within `PLANE_TOL` of each other, or further apart than that but too near
//! for the depth buffer to tell apart from the nearest place a camera comes.
//! And only where it can be seen: no closed box presses on the fight from in
//! front (a crate's bottom on the floor), and a face looking down has room
//! under it for a camera.
//!
//! Ink, halos and shadows are left out: the vertex shader draws every ink
//! hull a few depth steps back and every halo and shadow a few forward
//! (`uBias` in `data/shaders/scene.vert`), so a tie with a solid always goes
//! the solid's way, or the halo's.
//!
//! The other flicker tests: depth precision at every ring distance and the
//! dithered hand-over (`render.rs`, `look.rs`), stable instance order
//! (`game.rs`), and identical pixels on two still frames (the browser check,
//! `tests/browser/interactions.py`).
