//! `sky`: the sky's share of the haze (M2 World, task W).
//!
//! The light, the sky's gradient and the haze into the sky's colour are
//! Protection of the Spheres' and Iron Vector's, in `look.rs` and
//! `data/look.json`; the sun stays where M0 put it, low in the
//! west-south-west. Two things are added here, in `data/sky.json`, for the
//! draw distance:
//!
//! - **The edge.** The haze grows as 1 − e^(−kd), which never reaches the
//!   sky: 9% of the land's own colour is left at 16 km, enough to see where
//!   the land ends at the far plane. Between `edge_m` the haze is made whole,
//!   so the last land is the sky's colour before the far plane cuts it.
//! - **The air's colour.** Over the middle distance the haze turns toward a
//!   cool blue (`aerial`), so far ridges stand as blue layers against the
//!   warm horizon; by the horizon the haze is the sky's colour again, so the
//!   land still meets the sky with no seam.
//!
//! The values reach `scene.frag` and `water.frag` as uniforms after the
//! look's (`api::numbers`, the shim's `uniforms`), D3.
