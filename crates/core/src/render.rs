//! What the page draws: one instance array and one draw list a frame
//! (CW-5), and a static array uploaded once. Long Time Comin's renderer
//! contract (one 3×4 matrix, a colour and one more value per shape, grouped
//! so each (mesh, pass) is one instanced draw), with two additions:
//!
//! - **Depth layers.** One 24-bit depth range from 0.4 m to 16 km cannot
//!   tell apart two surfaces 160 m apart at the horizon. The frame is drawn
//!   in two ranges instead, the far one first (112 m to 16 km), then the
//!   depth buffer is cleared and the near one drawn (0.4 m to 128 m). A
//!   shape drawn in the 16 m both share is drawn in both, and the near
//!   layer's pixels win there, so the seam has no crack. `depth_step` and
//!   its tests give the numbers (CW-18).
//! - **An origin.** Positions reach the page relative to a point near the
//!   camera (`ORIGIN_CELL` grid), so the floats the GPU uses keep a tenth of
//!   a millimetre everywhere in the 4 km square. The static array is rebuilt
//!   when the camera crosses into another cell (`Scene::version`).
//!
//! Passes, in draw order: `Sky` (the dome round the eye, unlit, no depth),
//! `Solid` (lit), `Dither` (lit, and each pixel kept or dropped by the
//! ordered dither for M2's detail hand-over), `Ink` (the outline: the same
//! shape grown and drawn with its front faces culled, which leaves a rim),
//! `Shade` (soft round shadows, blended), `Glow` (halos, added). The page
//! sets the GL state each pass needs from `pass_states()`, so it knows no
//! pass by name.
//!
//! Instance values (16 Q16 integers; the shim hands the page floats): the
//! three columns of the shape's
//! linear part with the translation's x, y, z in each fourth slot, then the
//! colour and one value whose meaning is the pass's: Solid, the glow (0 lit,
//! `ONE` unlit); Dither and Ink, the dither fade (`look::keeps`; `ONE` keeps
//! every pixel); Glow and Shade, the strength.
//!
//! Extension (M1–M7): a module draws by pushing shapes, in world
//! coordinates, into the `Shapes` it is handed: `World::draw` for things that
//! move (drawn at `alpha` between the last two ticks), `World::scene` for
//! things that do not (a `Group` with a centre and radius, so whole groups
//! are left out of a layer they cannot reach). Push in a fixed order:
//! the instance array must be the same for the same world (CW-18).
